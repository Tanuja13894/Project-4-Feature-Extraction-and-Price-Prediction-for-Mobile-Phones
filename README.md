# Project-4-Feature-Extraction-and-Price-Prediction-for-Mobile-Phones
Overview:-
This project aims to predict the prices of mobile phones based on their features using machine learning techniques. It involves extracting relevant features from mobile phone datasets and building predictive models to estimate their market prices.

Key Components:-
Data Collection:-
Describe where the data was sourced from.
Briefly mention the dataset size and attributes.

Feature Extraction:-
Explain the process of selecting and extracting features from the dataset.
Highlight key features that are expected to influence the price prediction.

Data Preprocessing:-
Outline steps taken to clean the data (handling missing values, outliers, etc.).
Mention any transformations or normalization applied to the features.

Modeling:-
Specify the machine learning models used for price prediction (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks).
Discuss reasons for choosing specific models and any adjustments made (e.g., hyperparameter tuning).

Evaluation:-
Describe the metrics used to evaluate model performance (e.g., MAE, MSE, R-squared).
Present evaluation results and discuss the model's effectiveness.

Deployment:-
the model can be deployed in a real-world scenario (e.g., API, web application).

Future Improvements:-
Suggest potential enhancements or additional features that could improve the model's accuracy or usability.
Discuss any limitations encountered during the project.

Conclusion:-
Summarize the project's goals, methodologies, and findings.
Reflect on lessons learned and insights gained from the project.

Acknowledgments:-
Acknowledge any external resources, libraries, or datasets used in the project.
